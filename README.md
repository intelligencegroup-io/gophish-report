# Gophish Report

Gophish Report is a Python tool for transforming raw Gophish CSV exports into interactive HTML reports. It visualises phishing campaign data, user interactions, IP geolocation details, and captured credentials. This enables security teams, penetration testers, and red teams to analyse Gophish results with precision.

## üåê IP Lookup Configuration

Gophish Report uses [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) to perform IP geolocation lookups on public IP addresses, providing details like city, region, country, and ISP or organisation.

- Sign up for a free ipinfo.io account: [https://ipinfo.io/signup](https://ipinfo.io/signup)
- The free plan offers 50,000 requests per month.

After signing up, you will receive an API token, for example `abcd123456efgh`.

---

### How to Add Your API Token

Open the Python script and locate this line near the top:

```python
IPINFO_TOKEN = "your_api_token_here"
```

Replace the placeholder with your token:

```python
IPINFO_TOKEN = "abcd123456efgh"
```

Once updated, the tool will use your token for all IP lookups.

---

**Note:**
- Private or reserved IP addresses, such as 192.168.x.x, are automatically excluded from lookups.
- Only public IPs are sent to ipinfo.io.
